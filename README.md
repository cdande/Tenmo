Tenmo

Created a server and client application that consumed Restful APIs. I used Git and Gitlab to collaborate with a small team to complete the project over a period of 3 days.  The application stores the information in a SQL database which was accessed through C# and the API. The application allows the user to register an account, view account balance, send money to specific users, and has a list of past transfers.
